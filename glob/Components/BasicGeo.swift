 There is no way to alter the data once it is created and rendered.
 An option may be to use: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scngeometrysource/1522873-geometrysourcewithbuffer
 
 However, another idea is to use an array of values, from which
 the vectors are generated and model can be displayed.
 The renderer would then need to remove and re-implement the geo/node
 whenever a new vector/tri/quad is added.
